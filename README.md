OSCP Preparation Box Writeups


My notetaking app of choice is Obsidian and I've documented all of my writeups using this tool. Here I've stored the Obsidian files if you want to download them and view them that way.


The format I use for my Obsidian writeups is:

01. Recon
02. Exploitation
03. Privilege Escalation

This makes it easy to find the appropriate steps and orders them in a neat and orderly fashion inside Obsidian. Download the files into the same vault folder (example: Obsidian Vault > Twiggy > Twiggy.
